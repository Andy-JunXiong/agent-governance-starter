# ADR-{{ADR_NUMBER}}: {{ADR_TITLE}}

## Decision gate

Create or retain this ADR only when all answers are yes:

- [ ] Reversing the decision later would have meaningful cost.
- [ ] Future maintainers would lose important context without this record.
- [ ] At least two plausible alternatives have a real tradeoff.

If the gate does not pass, record the choice in an ordinary design note or
task instead.

## Context

Describe the observed problem, current constraints, and evidence that makes a
durable decision necessary. Separate verified repository facts from assumptions
and expected future pressure.

## Decision

State the chosen rule or architecture in direct language. Identify what becomes
required, allowed, forbidden, or explicitly deferred.

## Owns

- {{BOUNDARY_OWNED_BY_THIS_ADR}}

## Does not own

- {{RELATED_BUT_SEPARATE_BOUNDARY}}

## Invariants created or changed

- Invariant record: `{{INVARIANT_ID_OR_NONE}}`
- Enforcement point: `{{CODE_POLICY_OR_REVIEW_GATE}}`

Use `none` when the decision creates no durable invariant. Do not invent an
invariant merely to make the section non-empty.

## Consequences

### Benefits

- {{EXPECTED_BENEFIT}}

### Costs and risks

- {{KNOWN_COST_OR_RISK}}

### Operational impact

- {{DEPLOYMENT_MONITORING_OR_SUPPORT_IMPACT}}

## Alternatives considered

### {{ALTERNATIVE_NAME}}

Describe the alternative, why it was plausible, and why it was not selected.

## Implementation plan

1. {{SMALLEST_IMPLEMENTATION_STEP}}
2. {{VALIDATION_OR_MIGRATION_STEP}}

List separate approval gates explicitly. An accepted ADR does not itself grant
permission to edit protected files, mutate external systems, or release code.

## Validation

- Automated: `{{AUTOMATED_VALIDATION_COMMAND}}`
- Manual: {{MANUAL_VALIDATION_OR_NOT_REQUIRED}}
- Success signal: {{BINARY_ACCEPTANCE_SIGNAL}}

## Rollback or replacement

Describe how the decision can be superseded, what state must be migrated, and
which invariant or enforcement point must be removed or replaced.

## Open questions

- {{OPEN_QUESTION_OR_NONE}}
